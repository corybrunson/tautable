Description: The package consists of several basic functions for generating
    tables of critical values for Kendall's rank correlation coefficient tau and
    related test statistics by two means: reverse-determination using
    implementions of tau (with p-values) on pairs of vectors (slow) and
    construction from scratch using the recurrence relation for the Mahonian
    numbers (fast).
Depends:
